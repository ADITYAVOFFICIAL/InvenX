# Overview

Inventory Maintainer is a smart warehouse management system that optimizes demand forecasting, inventory placement, and transportation logistics using machine learning and AI-driven recommendations.

# Problem Statement

Traditional warehouse management faces several challenges:

Inaccurate Demand Forecasting: Manual forecasting leads to overstocking or understocking, causing financial losses and inventory waste.
Inefficient Storage Utilization: Poor warehouse layouts reduce space efficiency, increasing costs and retrieval time.
High Transportation Costs: Suboptimal stock distribution results in unnecessary transfers, leading to increased logistics costs and delays.

# 🛠️ Solution

✅ Optimal Warehouse Assortment Selection
Machine Learning Models: Uses Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks to predict regional demand based on historical sales and external factors.
Generative AI for Inventory Placement: Recommends optimized warehouse assortment to minimize waste and maximize efficiency.

🚚 Cost-Effective Parcel & Transportation Delivery
Route Optimization: Uses TomTom API and weather conditions to suggest the most cost-efficient delivery routes.

🔄 Inventory Movement Recommendations
ML-Based Transfer Recommendations: Algorithms like XGBoost and Random Forest analyze inventory levels, demand forecasts, and transportation costs to recommend optimal stock transfers between warehouses.
